## 🎯 Project Purpose

Atomic SecOps is designed to unify detection rules for security operations by mapping **Sigma rules** to **Google SecOps YARAL rules** and correlating them with **Atomic Red Team** adversary emulation tests. This provides **SOC teams and threat hunters** with a structured and actionable detection library.

### [Explore the Atomic SecOps Mapping](https://atomicsecops.com)

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Data Sources**
   - **Atomic Red Team**: Provides adversary simulation test cases mapped to MITRE ATT&CK techniques.
   - **Sigma Rules**: Open-source detection rules mapped to relevant threats.
   - **Google SecOps YARAL**: Converted Sigma rules tailored for Google’s Unified Data Model (UDM).

2. **Automated Mapping**
   - Each **Sigma rule filename** is matched against **corresponding YARAL rules**.
   - Techniques from **Atomic Red Team** are linked with their **Sigma and SecOps detections**.
   - A **unified web interface** dynamically presents these mappings for easy reference.

3. **Live Threat Intelligence & Testing**
   - Security teams can **search, filter, and validate** detections based on MITRE ATT&CK techniques.
   - Analysts can execute **Atomic Red Team tests** and quickly access relevant detection logic.
   
## 🛠️ Project Origin

This project emerged from the need to bridge **threat simulation** with **real-world detection**. By leveraging Atomic Red Team for execution and Google SecOps for detection, **SOC analysts and blue teams** can improve their detection engineering workflows.

## Credit

This project was heavily inspired by [AttackRuleMap](https://github.com/krdmnbr/AttackRuleMap).  

Conversions were assisted by a heavily doctored version of [pySigma Google SecOps (AttackIQ)](https://github.com/attackIQ/pySigma-Google-SecOps).

Adversary emulation scenarios are credited to the excellent team at Red Canary's [Atomic Red Team](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team).  

Framework mappings and ATT&CK matrix concepts are credited to [The MITRE Corporation](https://github.com/mitre-attack).  

Finally, special appreciation and respect to Florian Roth at [SigmaHQ](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma), whose pioneering contributions continue to inspire detection engineers around the globe.
