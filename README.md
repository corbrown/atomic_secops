## üéØ Project Purpose

The purpose of Atomic SecOps Mapping is to streamline the integration of detection rules into modern security operations. By converting and mapping rules (such as Sigma rules) into YARAL, this project enables security teams to rapidly deploy and validate detections within the Google SecOps framework. This helps ensure that adversary simulations and threat detection capabilities are in sync.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Origin

This project was born out of the need to enhance detection capabilities in a personal lab environment. Through the execution of simulated attacks and rigorous testing, detection rules were collected, converted, and mapped to the UDM used in Google SecOps. The conversion process combines both automated scripts and manual fine-tuning to achieve optimal compatibility and performance.

## ü§ù Contribution

Contributions are welcome! Here are a few ways you can help improve Atomic SecOps Mapping:

- **Rule Testing & Validation:** Help test the converted rules across different environments and provide feedback on their performance.
- **Conversion Enhancements:** Propose or implement improvements to the rule conversion scripts to handle new edge cases.
- **Documentation:** Improve this README and other documentation to better explain the mapping process and integration details.
- **General Feedback:** Open issues with suggestions, bug reports, or feature requests.

Feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue if you have ideas or improvements.
